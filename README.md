### What the heck is this?

A repo to implement https://www.eloibarti.com/blog/a-quick-dive-into-heat-transfer-i

### Hmm let me guess, it is not done yet is it?

This is obvi still TBC.


### Something else?

This first implementation is rough and really shitty. Please do not look into it too much. I just wanted to validate the assumptions and the convergence of the proposed solution.

The solver does converge - albeit I am now transitioning it to Objective-C to make use of my external GPU when solving all them matrices. 


### Observations:
Apple's developer guide SUCKS!.
